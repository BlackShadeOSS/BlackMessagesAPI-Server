# blackmessagesapi-server

This is a REST API server for BlackMessages App.

It runs using bun and connects to ScyllaDB cluster

If you want to run it (you probably don't) clone the repo, create a .env file where you put your credentials for ScyllaDB then run `bun install` and after that `bun run index.ts`
